        <p>Data Driven Drug Design</p>
    </header>

At Volkamer Lab, we develop methods at the interface between structural bioinformatics and cheminformatics, mostly applied in the context of computer-aided drug design with a focus on machine learning methods.

On one hand, we investigate [structure-based methods](/research/structure-based/) for active site assessment, including [binding site comparison](/research/structure-based/binding-sites/), [pharmacophore elucidation](/research/structure-based/pharmacophores/) and off-target prediction; pocket-centric [fragment-based design](/projects/kinfraglib/) as well as [deep learning enhanced virtual screening pipelines](/projects/deeplearning-vs/). Besides target-independent approaches, we focus our developments on [kinases](/research/structure-based/kinases/), one of the major classes of therapeutic targets. Recently, we started to extend our portfolio to identify novel anti-infectives.

On the other hand, we study ligand-based methods, including [machine learning methods for activity and toxicity prediction](/research/machine-learning/) and apply them in translational projects. Special focus is set on integrating novel techniques taking the [applicability and reliability into account](/projects/knowtox/), and the [interpretability of deep learning methods](/projects/cytotox/). Besides revolutionizing drug design, our goal is the establishment of alternative _in silico_ methods to determine the risk of compounds and their harmful effects on humans, animals, plants and environment (see <a href="https://www.bb3r.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" class="external">BB3R platform</a>).

Additionally, we continuously work on the integration of the two research areas of structure- and ligand-centered projects, i.e., focusing on [structure-informed machine learning approaches](/projects/kinoml/) applied primarily to [kinases](/research/openkinome/). In this attempt, we are integrating the physical aspects into molecular modelling (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations) to better sample the drug target interactions. The [OpenKinome](/research/openkinome/) initiative is an ongoing collaboration with the <a href="http://www.choderalab.org/" target="_blank" class="external">lab of Prof. John Chodera</a>, our <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/fellows-projects/einstein-fellows-professors/einstein-bih-visiting-fellows/john-chodera" target="_blank" class="external">Einstein BIH Visiting Fellow</a>.
    
We are also working together on campus to advance the field of rational drug discovery through the development of neuro-explicit AI models, find out more about NextAID [here]( https://nextaid.cs.uni-saarland.de/).
