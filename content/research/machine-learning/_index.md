Machine learning (ML) algorithms, and more recently deep learning (DL) methods, have proven to perform well in different chemical related fields, and are thus broadly used in drug design and toxicity prediction. Given a labeled data set with known outcome, the ML algorithm learns to identify the often highly non-linear combinations of physico-chemical and structural features in the underlying data (e.g. compounds, protein structures or complexes) that may be responsible for their (toxic) effect.
