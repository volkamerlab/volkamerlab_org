Target deconvolution is a vital initial step in preclinical drug development to determine research focus and strategy.
In this respect, computational target prediction is used to identify the most probable targets of an orphan ligand or the most similar targets to a protein under investigation.
Applications range from the fundamental analysis of the mode-of-action over polypharmacology or
adverse effect predictions to drug repositioning.

Binding site comparison is one of the methods useful to make such predictions and works in three steps:
1. For a target of interest, the binding site is detected and encoded,
2. this binding site is subsequently compared to a database of pre-encoded binding sites of
structurally available macromolecules, and
3. the most similar binding sites (ranked by a scoring function) are proposed
as potential off-targets or polypharmacological targets.
