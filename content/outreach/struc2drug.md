#### July 15, 2021 (online)
**Computational tools guiding drug discovery for ion channels and kinases**<br />
**David Mauricio Ramírez Sánchez** (Universidad Autónoma de Chile) & **Dominique Sydow** (Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin)<br />
This session is getting more computational again! We will discuss computational strategies guiding drug discovery for two important drug targets: ion channels and kinases.
<a href="https://ramirezlab.github.io/index">David Mauricio Ramírez Sánchez</a> will talk about two pore domain TASK channels linked to breast cancer, sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Guided by the molecular basis of TASK1 and TASK3 channel modulation by known drugs, his group has designed new compounds using pharmacophore-based virtual screening. The best candidates are now optimized using medicinal chemistry.
Dominique Sydow, PhD student from the Volkamer Lab, will show how the structural information of kinase pockets can be encoded computationally and used to understand and predict (dis)similarities in this highly conserved protein class. These similarities can guide polypharmacology, off-target, and repurposing studies. Dominique will also shortly promote the TeachOpenCADD platform for everyone who is interested in learning Python programming in the context of cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics.

**Biomimetic and Stimuli-Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications**<br />
**Daniel Klinger** (FU, Berlin) & **Gregor Fuhrmann** (HIPS, Saarbrücken)<br />
Efficient delivery of therapeutics not only requires (nano)carriers to host and release drugs of often limited solubility, but also to address the complex structures of challenging biological barriers. Since this complexity prevents the utilization of a one-fits-all system, different (colloidal) carrier systems are being tailored to specific therapeutic needs. Among such delivery vehicles, this talk will focus on the potential of synthetic polymeric nanogels (NGs) and natural extracellular vesicles (EVs) as complementary approaches.
Daniel Klinger will present an overview of the research in the Klinger group where they combine different length scales in the synthetic design of stimuli-responsive NGs. He will give examples on how to adjust the carrier properties to deliver insoluble drugs, address challenging bio-barriers (e.g. skin), and target current threats (e.g. antimicrobial resistance). In addition, fundamental investigations to examine the potential of utilizing colloidal shape change as new targeting concept will be discussed.
Gregor Fuhrmann will present some of the recent efforts to better understand the biological role of EVs in infection and inflammation. He will provide an insight into the isolation and characterization of EVs and explain their potential loading with model compounds, from small molecule drugs to larger biomacromolecules. Moreover, he will present recent examples of combining EVs with novel biomaterial development, important foundations for their advanced biomedical development.

**Nanobodies in Structural Biology and Therapy**<br />
**Magdalena Schacherl** (Charité, Berlin) & **Amal Hassan** (Charité, Berlin)<br />
Nanobodies are versatile tools for structural biology and promising next-generation biodrugs. In this seminar, we will hear two talks on how the production and usage of nanobodies can facilitate protein structure determination and drug discovery. First, Magdalena Schacherl will introduce nanobodies and explain their use for structural biology research as well as their potential and application as therapeutics. Second, Amal Hassan will present her complex structure of the specific nanobody Nb11 with Gelsolin (GSN), a soluble protein responsible for a familial degenerative disease (AGel amyloidosis), solved at 1.9 Å resolution. This structural information, together with biochemical and biophysical studies, helped to decipher the pathological mechanism of a GSN disease-mutant.

**Computational Chemistry in Industry**<br />
**Jérémie Mortier** (Bayer, Berlin) & **Floriane Montanari** (Bayer, Berlin)<br />
Computational methods are employed in numerous ways in early drug development. In this seminar, we present two examples of how such methods are applied at Bayer to develop novel drugs. First, Jérémie Mortier will present an early synergistic research project applying computational molecular design to medicinal chemistry, in order to find drugs for KRAS. Since the discovery of the druggable allosteric binding site containing the G12C mutation, KRAS has attracted a lot of attention in oncology research and is now one of the most-studied anticancer targets. In the second talk, Floriane Montanari will explain how pharmacokinetic properties are predicted as part of the routine toolbox at Bayer. She discusses the continuous and reversible representation of compounds as SMILES and the application of deep learning methods to effectively predict physico-chemical properties of compounds in a multitask fashion.

**Mechanistic Insights in GPCR Signal Transduction**<br />
**Martha Sommer** (Charité, Berlin) & **Marcel Bermudez** (FU, Berlin)<br />
The importance of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal transduction research for medicine and human health cannot be overstated. While the field has undergone a revolution of understanding thanks to many technical advancements, GPCR signal transduction as a whole is not fully understood. Notably, potentially misleading paradigms regarding the complexities of GPCR signal transduction must be re-evaluated. In this seminar, we will present two research perspectives on GPCR signal transduction: 1) Ligand-dependent modulation of GPCR activity, including phenomena like partial agonism and biased signaling, and 2) Revisioning how GPCRs recruit, activate and bind their regulatory arrestin proteins. The seminar will conclude with a brief introduction of ERNEST, an EU-funded COST Action (consortium) focused on a holistic understanding of GPCR signal transduction and tackling the unresolved issues in the field.

**Ribosomal Biogenesis - a New Target for Antibiotics**<br />
**Rainer Nikolay** (Charité, Berlin) & **Theresa Noonan** (FU, Berlin)<br />
Ribosome Biogenesis: First, we will give an introduction how ribosomal subunits are produced by bacterial cells in a process known as ribosome biogenesis. During this process, ribosomal subunits are assembled in a stepwise manner. Highly resolved structural snapshots of intermediate states occurring along this pathway are available for Computer-aided Drug Design. Compounds with Antibiotic Potential: Furthermore, we will present our approach involving the structure based computational search for compounds interfering with the biogenesis of bacterial ribosomes. We will introduce some methods used in Computer-aided Drug Design, and describe how we used these along the journey from identifying suitable protein targets to identifying potential hits.
