Artificial intelligence is a key technology in computer science, the success of which continues to spread and is by no means limited to computer science and mathematics. Also in medicine, it is assumed that artificial intelligence will change medical research and medical care in the long term.

The goal of this course (_Wahlpflichtmodul M24_) is to familiarize medical students with this new technology, in particular to jointly work out basic concepts of machine learning, to reduce possible resistance to programming, to demonstrate various applications in medical research (from drug development to brain imaging for neurological diseases) and to critically assess them with regard to practical, legal and ethical aspects.

**Note**: This course is taught jointly with the group of <a href="https://psychiatrie-psychotherapie.charite.de/en/research/neuroimaging_and_neurotechnology/machine_learning/" target="_blank" class="external">Prof. Dr. Kerstin Ritter</a>.
