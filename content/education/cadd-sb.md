We offer courses and seminars focused mainly on data driven drug design embedded in the [Center for Bioinformatics at Saarland University](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en/). We also supervise students from bioinformatics, as well as computer and life sciences, in diverse individual research projects.

Our [CADD course](https://www.lsf.uni-saarland.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=140645&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung) is an interactive lecture, in which students learn various methods from structural bio- and cheminformatics, including available software tools and libraries, that support data generation and analysis in different areas of computer-aided drug design (CADD). 
The course sensitizes students to the straightforward and profitable use of bio-/cheminformatics methods. It is designed to enable students to build their own CADD pipeline, including protein target preparation, compound library assembly and filtering, protein-ligand docking and result evaluation. The course is composed of lectures to explain the various concepts, a brief introduction to Python programming using interactive Jupyter notebooks and exercises in which students develop their own scripts, leaning on [TeachOpenCADD]( https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd).



Our [CADD seminar](https://www.lsf.uni-saarland.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=144048&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung), is an introductory seminar to computer-aided drug design, including structure- and ligand-based methods. After giving a brief introduction, students select a topic from the presented drug development pipeline and independently acquire knowledge on the selected topics in the context of structural bio- and cheminformatics. 
Topics include homology modeling, target assessment, molecular docking, virtual screening, molecular fingerprints, chemical similarity, ADMET predictions and QSAR; especially with increased focus on ML and DL methods. Under guidance, material (papers, data and algorithms ) are collected by each student and presented at the end of the seminar, including the implementation of an application of the individual topics.

Our [ML models for drug design seminar](https://www.lsf.uni-saarland.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=147394&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung) focuses on the importance of reproducibility. Numerous research manuscripts, even in high-impact journals and covering broader topics of interest, often lack the necessary elements for easy reproducibility. In this seminar, attendees will receive research manuscripts that share data and software / scripts for download. Your task will involve summarizing the manuscript, similar to typical seminars, and reproducing one of the core results using the provided software and data.
