In this project, we want to be able to optimize molecular properties and/or generate new molecules with desired non-toxic properties using the Transformers model. Unlike currently available machine and deep learning methods, self supervised learning models, e.g., the transformers model, provide generalizability by being pre-trained on large unsupervised dataset then fine-tuned on small downstream datasets. The transformers model is highly resourceful with the ability to perform molecular property prediction, optimization, and/or generation.
