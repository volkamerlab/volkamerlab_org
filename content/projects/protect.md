In this project, we aim to explore the potential of transformer models to optimize molecular properties and/or generate 
new molecules with desired non-toxic properties. 

Transformer models are well-known for capturing long-distance relationships within an input sequence. This ability recruits 
them as promising candidates for capturing dependencies within the studied small molecules that can be redeemed important 
for understanding and controlling for toxic properties. The transformer 
architecture provides generalizability by being pre-trained on large unsupervised dataset then fine-tuned on small 
downstream datasets. It also comes in different flavors that makes suitable to perform molecular property 
prediction, optimization, and/or generation.
