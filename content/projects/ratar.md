How to probe and validate a potential target remains one of the key questions in basic research in life sciences.
In the DFG-project *Ratar* (Read-Across the Targetome), we will use binding site similarity to predict off-targets and
to extrapolate compound information from one target to another.
This similarity-based knowledge transfer can suggest tool compounds (chemical probes) and
off-targets for proteins of interest using the ever-growing amount of available target and compound data.
