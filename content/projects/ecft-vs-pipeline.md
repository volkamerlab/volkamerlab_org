Finding the optimal docking pipeline for a target is challenging. Our project aims to develop a data-driven pipeline to find new hits for Energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters through the optimization of various structure-based virtual screening workflows.

<!--more-->

Energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters are novel, promising antimicrobial targets which mediate micronutrient transport into the cell. Therefore this protein is a promising drug target. Absence of ligands with a co-crystallized protein with ligand and its cryptic binding pocket make it a challenging target. However, previous computational work at the Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS) revealed an opening pocket in ECF transporters for pantothenate.

To virtually screen a large in-house data of HIPS, we develop a structure-based, data-driven pipeline. In this approach we identify an efficient docking pipeline to our target to propose promising novel antibacterial agents, which can be tested further.
