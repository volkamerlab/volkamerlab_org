Finding the optimal docking pipeline for a target is challenging. Our project aims to develop a data-driven pipeline to find new hits for Energy coupling factor transporter (ECF-T) through the optimization of various structure-based virtual screening workflows.

<!--more-->

Energy coupling factor transporter (ECF-T) is a novel, promising antimicrobial target which midates the micronutrients' transportation into the cell. Inhibiting its activity reduces the viability of pathogens. However, Aabsence of ligands with a co-crystallized protein  with ligand and its cryptic binding pocket make it a challenging target.

Previous computational work at Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS) revealed an opening pocket in ECF-T for pantothenate. To virtually screen a large in-house data of HIPS, we develop a structure-based, data-driven pipeline. This approach identifies the optimal docking pipeline to our target to find most promising novel antibacterial agents, which will be tested further at HIPS.
