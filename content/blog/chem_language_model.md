Great collaborative work with ETH ZÃ¼rich is now published in the Digital discovery. Our model for molecular property prediction is validated on a large proprietary toxicity dataset, uses uncertainty to improve reliability , reveals cytotoxic motifs via attention and outperforms existing approaches! 

You can check the paper on [Born, 2023](/publications/#born_digitaldiscory_2023) and the code of the model is available [here](https://github.com/PaccMann/chemical_representation_learning_for_toxicity_prediction).
