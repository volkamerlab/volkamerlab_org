Great collaborative work with IBM research and ETH ZÃ¼rich is now published in Digital discovery. The model for molecular property prediction is validated on the large proprietary toxicity dataset from our previous study ([Webel, 2020](/publications/#webel_2020_cytotox)), uses uncertainty to improve reliability, reveals cytotoxic motifs via attention and outperforms existing approaches! 

You can check the paper on [Born, 2023](/publications/#born_digitaldiscory_2023) and the code of the model is available [here](https://github.com/PaccMann/chemical_representation_learning_for_toxicity_prediction).
