Lisa and Kerstin, who now is a junior professor at Universtiy Medicine Göttingen, attended together the BioTechX Europe 2025 conference in Basel. They presented together a poster "Increasing trustworthiness of machine learning-based drug sensitivity prediction with a multivariate random forest approach", which is also published on [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/doi/full/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ml78s). It was a great opportunity to share our work and interact with fellow researches in academia and industry.
