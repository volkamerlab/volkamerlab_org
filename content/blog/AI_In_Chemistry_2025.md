As part of the **8th Artificial Intelligence in Chemistry Symposium**  
([AiChem 8 conference website](https://www.rscbmcs.org/events/aichem8/)), Raquel, Afnan, and Lisa participated in both the pre-conference workshop and the main conference, contributing to discussions at the intersection of chemistry, data science, and machine learning.

Raquel, Afnan, Lisa, Andrea and [Pat](https://patwalters.github.io/) **organized the pre-conference workshop**, which focused on introducing practical machine learning workflows for chemistry. Lisa introduced the basics of **Python and Jupyter notebooks**, Raquel presented a hands-on notebook on **data curation and cleaning**, and Afnan explored **molecular representations and machine learning models** commonly used in cheminformatics. The workshop lectures and notebooks are publicly available  
([GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkamerlab/ai_in_chemistry_workshop_2025)).

In the main conference, both Raquel and Afnan presented their research as oral contributions. Raquel presented her ongoing work titled **“No Pose Left Behind: Integrating Activity and Structural Data with Uncertainty-Aware Multiobjective Learning for Kinase Inhibitor Prediction”**, highlighting methods for combining structural and bioactivity data in predictive modeling. Afnan presented her work on **molecular transformers**, discussing their applications and evaluation for molecular property prediction tasks.

Lisa presented a poster on her work on **benchmarking of different machine learning models, compound representations and dimension reduction methods** on the ToxCast dataset.  


We especially enjoyed engaging with the AiChem community and exchanging ideas with researchers working across machine learning, cheminformatics, and data-driven drug discovery.
