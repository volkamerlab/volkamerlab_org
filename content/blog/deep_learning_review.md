Interested in the new developments of deep learning in virtual screening ? Check out our review [Kimber, 2021](/publications/#kimber_ijms_2021).
We discuss
- ligand, protein and complex encodings,
- deep learning models,
- data sets, and
- recent studies.

If you want to generate different encodings for your figures, have a look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkamerlab/DL_in_VS_review)!
