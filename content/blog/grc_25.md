This year’s Gordon’s Seminar and Conference on Computer-Aided Drug Design iteration was held in Portland, Maine. Paula contributed a spotlight presentation and a poster on fragment-based active learning for kinase ligand design. 
It was a great experience connecting with researchers from Europe and the U.S., and engaging in insightful discussions with both academic and industry experts.
