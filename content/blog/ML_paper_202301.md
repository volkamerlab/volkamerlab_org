Take a look at our newest opinion paper [Machine learning for small molecule drug discovery in academia and industry](https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ailsci.2022.100056).
Great collaboration with academic and industry colleagues discussing advances and challenges in molecular machine learning. Despite common overarching goals, we highlight the differences between academic and industry to improve models for e.g. drug selection and share ideas to improve collaborations.

Thanks to all co-authors for working together on this project with such enthusiasm!
