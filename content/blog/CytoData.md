Last week, the CytoData Hackathon in Berlin-Buch brought together researchers from different backgrounds to work on challenges in bio-image–based profiling, offering a great space for collaboration and exchange.

This was followed by the #CytoData2025 Symposium, where I presented ongoing work titled “Uncovering Compound Mode of Action via Hierarchical Clustering of Structural and Morphological Profiles” as part of the Morphology-based Endocrine Disruptors Screening project. The project aims to predict endocrine disruption by combining Cell Painting profiles with cheminformatics methods.

Thanks to the organizing committee and EU-OPENSCREEN for a well-organized and welcoming event.
