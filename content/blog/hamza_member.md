Hamza holds a bachelor's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences and a master's degree in Bioinformatics from Saarland University, and he is joining as a PhD candidate. He completed his master's thesis in the Volkamer Lab, developing [MolDockLab]({{< ref "/projects/moldocklab.md" >}}).

In his doctoral research, Hamza will focus on developing a physics-based scoring function for protein-ligand interactions. His work aims to advance structure-based virtual screening techniques for hit identification, which is crucial in the early stages of drug development.
