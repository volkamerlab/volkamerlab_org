## New Book Chapter: Morphological Data Analysis for Predictive Modelling

We are happy to share that a new protocol has been published in *Methods in Molecular Biology* (MIMB, Volume 2989) titled  
**“Morphological Data Analysis: From Descriptor Development to Predictive Modelling.”**
The chapter is based on work carried out during the first year of my PhD project and focuses on the computational analysis of **morphological fingerprints** derived from **Cell Painting** assays. These fingerprints capture quantitative information about cellular morphology, texture, and organelle organization, and can be used for downstream applications such as **compound similarity search** and **activity prediction** using machine learning methods.

The protocol provides a step-by-step overview of the analysis workflow and is organized into three main sections, each accompanied by [**Jupyter notebooks**](https://github.com/volkamerlab/MIMB_cellpainting_tutorial/tree/main) to support practical implementation.

Chapter is available here:  
[Read the protocol on Springer](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-4985-5_8)
