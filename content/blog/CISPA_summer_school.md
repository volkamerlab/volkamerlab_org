This year’s [CISPA summer school](https://cispa.de/summer-school-2025) was co-organized by ELLIS and ELSA from 4th-8th of August 2025 and covered the topic "Trustowrthy AI - Secure and Safe Foundation Models". Lisa presented her first poster, entitled 'Trustworthy Machine Learning for Chemical Risk Assessment' showing the work she is doing for the RADAR project. It was a great opportunity to share our work and interact with fellow researches in academia and industry.
