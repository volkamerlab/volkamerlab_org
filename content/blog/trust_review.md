We are happy to announce that the preprint of our paper “The Trustworthiness Landscape in Machine Learning: A Conceptual Guide with Applications in Medicine” is finally live on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/17591544](https://zenodo.org/records/17591544). It explains more than 17 concepts related to the trustworthiness of machine learning (ML), including, e.g., reliability, robustness, fairness, interpretability/explainability, security and privacy, and explores how these concepts connect and conflict.
It is targeted at anyone who wants to use ML responsibly, and especially researchers who encounter ML-based science in their daily work (not necessarily as developers). No extensive ML background is expected. <br /> 

The project was lead by first author Prof. Dr. Kerstin Lenhof, the head of the AI and multi-omics data group at the University Medicine Göttingen (UMG). The paper was writtin in collaboration with many amazing researchers from different backgrounds and insitutions: Lorina Buhr (UMG), Sebastian Roth (University of Bayreuth), Ruta Binkyte(CISPA), Silke Schicktanz (UMG), Mario Fritz (CISPA), and Niko Beerenwinkel (ETH Zürich).
