Have a look at our [PLIPify](/projects/plipify/) work (WIP)! 
PLIPify provides a wrapper around [PLIP](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/W1/W443/2467865), which allows to digest multiple structures at once, performs the mapping of the individual profiles to fingerprints and reports protein-ligand interaction frequencies.

It has recently been applied to detect the main interaction within a set of roughly 400 MPro complex structures (large crystal-based fragment screen by [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem/Downloads.html)) in the broader scope of the [COVID Moonshot](https://postera.ai/moonshot) initiative.

Check out the results in the latest COVID Moonshot preprint: "Open Science Discovery of Oral Non-Covalent SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitor Therapeutics" ([DOI: 10.1101/2020.10.29.339317v2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.339317v2)).
