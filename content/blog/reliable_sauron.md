We are happy to announce that our paper "Reliable anti-cancer drug senstivity prediction and prioritization" was finally published in Scientific Reports. Tackling the challenge of reliable ML predictions in medical applications, we developed a novel approach for predicting and prioritizing anti-cancer drug responses with guaranteed certainty levels, a unique contribution to the field. This research was conducted in collaboration with Kerstin Lenhof, Lea Eckhart, Lisa-Marie Rolli, and Hans-Peter Lenhof from the Lenhof chair.
