This year's [RDKit user group meeting](https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2023) was held in Mainz from 20th-22nd of September 2023. We presented the [TeachOpenCADD Deep Learning](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/) extension at the poster session, in addition to Andrea giving a lightning talk about the project. Michael and Joschka (from Prof. Verena Wolf's lab) presented their current project [Kinodata-3D](https://volkamerlab.org/projects/kinodata-3d/) in a lightning talk. It was a great opportunity to hear about RDKit updates and meet the community.
