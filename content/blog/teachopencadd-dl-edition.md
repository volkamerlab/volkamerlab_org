**We are thrilled to announce the release of [TeachOpenCADD Deep Learning (DL) Edition](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/646b465ff2112b41e9f49997), an expansion of TeachOpenCADD platform!** 
If you are not familiar with TeachOpenCADD platform, more information is provided on its [website](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/) or [here](https://volkamerlab.org/2021/12/teachopencadd-2021-release/).

The DL edition offers a comprehensive introduction to various deep learning topics with a focus on its application to drug discovery tasks. It empowers learners to explore and understand various concepts in DL field accomodating beginner users to advanced levels.

**Here is a preview of the talktorials included in TeachOpenCADD-DL Edition:**

- `T033` **Molecular Representations** : Learn the fundamentals of molecular representations in DL tasks.
- `T034` **Recurrent Neural Networks** : Dive into the world of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and its application to predict molecular property.
- `T035` **Graph Neural Networks** : Use GNNs for learning from molecular graphs and predicting molecular properties.
- `T036` **Equivariant Graph Neural Network** : Explain concept of equivariant graph neural networks (eGNNs) and their role in capturing 3D information of molecular structures for molecular property prediction.
- `T037` **Uncertainty Estimation** : Evaluate and quantify uncertainty in predictive models,  with reliable confidence measures.
- `T038` **Protein-Ligand Interaction Prediction** : Predict interactions between protein and ligands using GNNs.
