Starting the new year by publishing a paper [Hit Optimization by Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry on Streptococcus pneumoniae Energy-Coupling Factor Transporter (ECF)-PanT](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CC04738E).

We had a great collaboration with the Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS), identifying potential hits for energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters by computationally analyzing the binding pocket using molecular dynamics simulations.

Thanks to the great collaboration on this project â€” we're looking forward to discovering more hits!
