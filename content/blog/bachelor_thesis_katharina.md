We are happy to annouce that Katharina successfully submitted my bachelor thesis 'Novel Kinase Ligand Generation using Subpocket-Based Docking'. Within this thesis, we developed an approach to automatically and efficiciently generated novel kinase using the structural information of the protein kinase  target of interest but also the prior knowledge about kinase ligands and the inforamtion on functional important subpockets/regions of highly conserved kinase binding pocket. 

As a student researcher at the Volkamer Lab, she will further work on this project to refine and improve the pipeline, e.g. adding a feature to enhance the diversity of generated ligands. In addition, we are working on a case study with our collaberation partners for experimental validation.
