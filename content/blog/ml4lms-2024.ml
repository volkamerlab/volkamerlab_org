As part of the ICML conference in Vienna, we attended the Machine Learning for Life and Material Science [workshop](https://ml4lms.bio/) in Vienna, Austria on July 26th. Michael and Joschka presented their poster on the current updates on their [kinodata-3d](https://volkamerlab.org/projects/kinodata-3d/) project by investigating the explainability of their structural model for binding affinity prediction. Paula presented an approach for fragment-based kinase inhibitor design using active learning on her poster. We especially enjoyed meeting fellow researchers working in the intersection of machine learning and drug discovery.
