We recently published a literature review in *Frontiers in Toxicology* titled “Unleashing the Potential of Cell Painting Assays for Compound Activities and Hazards Prediction.”  
This paper is part of the research topic “Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Open Science for Toxicological Risk Assessment.”  
In this review, we highlight how single-cell-level data from cell painting assays can be combined with structural information to predict compound activities for various human-relevant disease endpoints and to identify underlying modes of action using machine learning and deep learning. We also discuss the current challenges associated with this approach.
