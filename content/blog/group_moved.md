We are happy to announce that the lab moved to [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), where we focus on **Data Driven Drug Design**! 
We are embedded in a vibrant environment, located in the [Center for Bioinformatics](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en/latest-news.html) and being part of [Saarland Informatics Campus](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/) as well as the [HIPS](https://www.helmholtz-hips.de/en/).

We are thankful for the time at Charité Berlin and are looking forward to many interesting projects and collaborations in Saarbrücken.
