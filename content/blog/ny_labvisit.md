Paula was awarded a Fulbright research scholarship to visit the Chodera Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City for four months. She spent the time at the lab to learn about relative binding free energy calculations for kinases and integrating this into her kinase-focused research. She also had the opportunity to get insight into the lab to measure kinase affinities. She enjoyed her time exploring the city, spending time with the lab outside of work and visiting different seminars in New York to connect with US-based researchers.
