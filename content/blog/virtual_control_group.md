Have a look on our [newest publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1142534/full) presenting a method to generate and validate Virtual Control Groups (VCGs) in systemic toxicity studies. This paper highlights the impact of anesthetics on measured electrolytes in animals and presents how these anesthetic protocols can affect the performance of virtual control groups.
