Hamza has successfully defended his masterâ€™s thesis titled **"MolDockLab: A Data-Driven Approach to Optimizing Docking Tools, Scoring Functions, and Ranking Methods for Targeted Applications."**

In his research, he developed MolDockLab, a data-driven approach for optimizing the combination of docking tools, scoring functions, and ranking methods for specific targets. Using energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters as a case study, his approach identified 18 compounds from the in-house HIPS library for further in vitro assays.
