Hamza had the opportunity to present part of his PhD research at [IOCB Tech](https://www.iocb.cz/) in Prague, where a [CECAM flagship workshop](https://www.cecam.org/) focused on Quantum Chemistry for Drug Design was hosted. Hamza's talk covered the topic of adapting machine learning potentials into a physics-based scoring function, which represents a key aspect of his doctoral research. The workshop brought together experts in quantum chemistry and computational drug design, providing an excellent platform for stimulating discussions and valuable feedback.

Following the workshop in Prague, Hamza attended the [RDKit UGM 2025](https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2025), which took place directly after in Prague as well. The RDKit UGM provided another great opportunity to connect with the cheminformatics community and explore the latest developments in open-source tools for computational chemistry and drug discovery.
