This year’s [EUROPIN Summer School on Drug Design](https://pharminfo.univie.ac.at/summerschool/2025/) was organized by the Pharmacoinformatics research group in Vienna from 14th-19th of September 2025. Floriane presented a poster on “Integrating structural and morphological fingerprints: Understanding information for pattern identification and better toxicity prediction”. Paula presented her poster on “Active learning for fragment-based kinase inhibitor design”, for which she won the poster prize. 
In addition, as part of the EUROPIN PhD program, they both gave their application talks presenting their current research projects. Floriane talked about Uncovering Compound Mode of Action and Patterns via Hierarchical Clustering of Structural and Morphological Profiles. Paula presented her current project on fragment-based active learning for kinase ligand generation. It was a great opportunity to share our work and interact with fellow researches in academia and industry.
