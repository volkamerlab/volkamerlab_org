This yearâ€™s [EUROPIN Summer School on Drug Design](https://pharminfo.univie.ac.at/summerschool/2023/) was organized by the Pharmacoinformatics research group in Vienna from 10th-15th of September 2023. Floriane and Paula attended and presented the [TeachOpenCADD Deep Learning](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/) extension at the poster session. In addition, as part of the EUROPIN PhD program, they both gave their introductory talks presenting their current research projects. Floriane talked about her machine learning approach for endocrine activity prediction using morphological fingerprints. Paula presented her current project which is on GNNs for subpocket-aware ligand generation in kinases. It was a great opportunity to share our work and interact with fellow researches in academia and industry.
